                The YD-TAP is our fundamental programme. It is more like a
                bedrock of OYDEI and we encourage our clients to participate in
                this programme because every youth is at a developing stage and
                he or she has numerous developmental tasks to achieve. Youth
                developmental tasks are tasks the youths need to achieve before
                they can become great, prosperous, and successful in life. The
                YD-TAP offers the youths ample opportunities to achieve their
                developmental tasks. We make several engagements with youths
                through our physical and online meetings, teachings, guidance,
                counselling, and mentorship to enable them to achieve their
                developmental tasks and prepare themselves for greatness,
                prosperity, and success.

                Most children and youths have lower emotional, academic,
                financial, and social intelligence which amounts to a lack of
                wisdom. As a result, they find it difficult to compete with
                their counterparts globally. Our EAFSIP focuses on scouting,
                mobilizing, and training children and youths with lower
                emotional, academic, financial, and social intelligence to
                increase their intelligence level and empower them with wisdom.
                Through this programme, we also train teachers, parents,
                counsellors, social workers, and caregivers on how to increase
                the intelligence and wisdom level of their children and youths.

                The ability to think critically and solve problems is in great
                demand locally and globally. Good critical thinkers can draw
                reasonable conclusions from a set of information and
                discriminate between useful and les useful details for solving a
                problem or making a decision. This is important for almost any
                job in any industry. Employers want job candidates who can
                evaluate a situation using logical thought and come up with the
                best solution. Someone with critical thinking skills can be
                trusted to make decisions on his or her own, and will not need
                constant handholding. Given this, we organize CTPSP regularly to
                help children and youths to cultivate these important skills.

                One may wonder why there is so many mistakes, errors, and
                regrets with regards to relationship and marriage, especially
                among young people. Relationship and marriage understanding is
                lacking among young people. Consequently, many young people have
                joined themselves with one another without the consent of their
                parents. Some waste so much time in boy-girl friendship, dating,
                and cohabitation that may be demanding, threatening, planless,
                purposeless, undirected, unguided, aimlessly drifting,
                deceitful, lustful, and immoral, with negative effect in many
                areas of their lives. Our RMP is primarily organized to enable
                young people to get understanding regarding relationships and
                marriage issues.

                Purpose is so important that God made it take the center of
                every life, and it is the determiner of every life&apos;s
                usefulness and relevance. That is, our educational
                qualifications, social status, economic class, political
                position, riches, religious accolades, and other achievements
                may be useless and irrelevant without purpose. Purpose is the
                meaning of life. It is like salt, which gives a taste to the
                soup. Purpose gives taste to life and makes it meaningful. That
                is, life is meaningless, drowsy, stressful, boring, wasteful,
                and fruitless without purpose. God made life depend on purpose
                because He didn&apos;t want anyone to live without purpose.
                Anybody that is living without purpose is good for nothing. As
                important as this may sound, many youths in Nigeria and other
                nations of the world have not discovered their purpose not to
                talk of fulfilling it. This makes our PDFP exciting, beneficial,
                and timely. This programme aims to help young people to discover
                their purpose and set up strategies that will enable them to
                fulfill the purpose. Series of teachings, guidance, counselling,
                and mentorship are carried out by experts to achieve this aim.

                Counselling is inevitable in today&apos;s personal, educational,
                social, economic, political, religious, and national
                transformation. As impressive as this might sound, practicing
                counsellors are lacking and counselling is not being practiced
                effectively in many sectors of society. An exception to this
                could be a few secondary schools that might have 1 or 2
                counsellors, who sometimes cannot practice counselling
                effectively in the schools due to challenges beyond their
                control. The yearly reports from student counselors who are sent
                by their training institutions to various settings (schools,
                prisons, hospitals, special education centers, etc.) for
                internship (what is called counselling practicum) further
                reveals the lapses that exist between counseling education and
                counselling practice. Some of the student counselors complained
                of not being welcomed adequately upon arrival at the centers,
                not being given time and space to practice counseling, being
                overloaded with other responsibilities that are not centered on
                counseling, being unable to attend adequately to the needs of
                all clients and potential clients, not having a legal backup to
                handle some cases, among other challenges. Likewise, resident
                counsellors in some settings might share the same challenges in
                addition to the challenge of managing a larger and multicultural
                population, adjusting to the technological phase of the society,
                and creating counselling impact in the society. It becomes
                imperative to harness the situation by creating an innovative
                counselling programme to raise a multitude of counselors who
                will volunteer to meet the counseling needs of society. This
                programme is tailored to the specific innovative skills,
                techniques, and ethics needed to do counseling work in schools,
                industries, prisons, churches, hospitals, and other settings.
                Both basic and advanced counseling skills and techniques are
                offered in this programme to enable both nonprofessional and
                professional counsellors to administer counseling services
                effectively. Moreover, this programme advocates that the primary
                work of the counsellor should be the primary work of every
                individual. Thus, the programme tends to educate the masses on
                the basic ways of counselling oneself and others. However, the
                professional aspect of counselling is well integrated into the
                programme to enable those that have professionalized and those
                that will be willing and able to professionalize in counselling
                to benefit from it.

                Effective career choice and development propgramme is the
                missing link or the gap between education, employment,
                entrepreneurship, and life sustainability. This gap has created
                a high rate of unemployment and other socio-economic problems
                and challenges among graduates in our nation and other parts of
                the world. The foremost problem is that many young people are
                not able to get admission to their chosen discipline and
                institution. Some are being offered admission to study the
                discipline that does not match their ability, personality,
                interest, and purpose. As a result, many young people are
                confused about their future careers. Some are unable to get
                admission even after participating four consecutive times in the
                Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). Those that
                get admission are still participating in UTME while some are
                applying for change of course, to enable them to migrate to the
                choice discipline. In our nation today, I cannot overemphasize
                the problem created by the lack of effective career choice and
                development propgramme. If left unchecked, the next generation
                will suffer greater losses. Therefore, OYDEI career experts work
                with secondary school students, individuals seeking admission
                into tertiary institutions, tertiary education students,
                graduates, and early career personnel to help them to make the
                right career choice; prevent the wrong choice of career; promote
                self-reliance and career self-efficacy; prevent future
                unemployment; build an entrepreneurship mindset; gain
                employability skills; prevent negative attitudes toward career;
                discover abilities, personality, skills, interest, talents, and
                purpose and match them with careers; study what career
                development is all about; and learn how to climb the ladder in a
                chosen career to the top.

                There is an alarming rise in psychological, mental, and
                behavioural disorders among young people all over the world. A
                lot of young people have experienced an increase in dementia,
                alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, tobacco use disorders
                chronic psychotic disorders, acute psychotic disorders, bipolar
                disorder, depression, phobic disorders, panic disorder,
                generalized anxiety, mixed anxiety, and depression, suicide
                ideation, adjustment disorder, dissociative (conversion)
                disorder, unexplained somatic complaints, neurasthenia, eating
                disorders, sleep problems, sexual disorders, mental retardation,
                hyperkinetic (attention deficit) disorder, conduct disorder, and
                bereavement disorders. This situation may get worst if tests and
                interventions are not provided to the young persons. Thus, this
                programme provides a platform for youths to test and receive
                intervention for their psychological, mental, and behavioural
                disorders.

                We organize this programme frequently to teach young people the
                proper way to “follow” and to “lead”. The right principles of
                followership and leadership should be understood by every young
                person who is interested in transforming society. A lot of
                people are pointing accusing fingers at their leaders when they
                are not good followers. We train the youths to be good citizens
                of their country so they can become good leaders that embrace
                transformative leadership practices. Also, in FLP, youths are
                empowered to embrace national loyalty and honesty, civic
                responsibilities, social justice, peace, unity, and right living
                intelligence.

                Many challenges confront students in primary, secondary and/or
                tertiary education institutions. The challenges may lead to a
                lack of motivation, low academic self- concept, truancy,
                aggression, violence, poor relationship, and even academic
                failure. Our AEP offers support to students by arming them with
                requisite skills and techniques for achieving their academic
                excellence.
